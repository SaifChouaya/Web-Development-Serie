<h2 style="color:red" align="center">Welcome to Our Web Development Course! 👋🌐</h2> 
<h4>⭐This is our first Serie; where we will dive into the world of designing and building <strong><i>STATIC</i></strong> Websites ⭐.</h4>
<h4>We will use in this first Serie: <strong><i>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</i></strong> 🧑🏻‍💻👩🏻‍💻. 
<br>Get ready to unleash your creativity and turn your web development dreams into reality 🚀💥.</h4>
<h5 align="center"> <strong><i><u>A STATIC WEBSITE</u></i></strong> is a collection of web pages whose content remains the same whenever users access it. Compared to a dynamic website, it is quicker and easier to create but has limited interactivity.<br> Static sites can be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without server-side scripting languages like PHP. Despite the limited functionality, they are excellent for specific use cases, such as portfolios.</h5>

<h5 align="center"> <strong><i><u>A DYNAMIC WEBSITE</u></i></strong> shows different content to different users. The content may depend on their locations, time zones, language preferences, or past behavior on the website.<br> Dynamic sites use a server-side programming language to connect with a database to enable interactive features and alter the content. Their common use cases include forums, social media platforms, and eCommerce sites.</h5>
<h5>Note: You can combine the two to create a  <strong><i><u>HYBRID WEBSITE</u></i></strong>. Use the static method for rarely updated sections and the dynamic one for interactive pages.</h5>
