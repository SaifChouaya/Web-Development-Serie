<h5  marginRight=300 align="center"><strong><i>A STATIC WEBSITE</i></strong> is a collection of web pages whose content remains the same whenever users access it. Compared to a dynamic website, it is quicker and easier to create but has limited interactivity.<br> Static sites can be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without server-side scripting languages like PHP. Despite the limited functionality, they are excellent for specific use cases, such as portfolios.</h5>

<h5>What Is a Dynamic Website?
A dynamic website shows different content to different users. The content may depend on their locations, time zones, language preferences, or past behavior on the website.</h5>
<br>
<h5>Dynamic sites use a server-side programming language to connect with a database to enable interactive features and alter the content. Their common use cases include forums, social media platforms, and eCommerce sites.</h5>
<br>
<h5>Note: You can combine the two to create a hybrid website. Use the static method for rarely updated sections and the dynamic one for interactive pages.</h5>
